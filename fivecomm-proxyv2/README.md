# Fidal Control Server

## Major version features
##### **v1.0.x** 
This version implements the integration of the previous proxy using Node.js in this case. It enables bidirectional communication between Unity and the robot, allowing the robotâ€™s status information to be sent to Unity and enabling control of the robot from Unity. This setup supports multiple robots, each with its respective cockpit in Unity.

Implemented Unity-Server messaging system using UDP Socket.
